## Hi there! ðŸ˜Ž

I'm Linyi, and welcome to my personal blog. I live in the beautiful city of Montreal, where I spend my time exploring my passions for software development, outdoor adventures, and sharing knowledge.
           
As a Fullstack Developer, I focus on ASP.NET and Angular, and I am also a DevOps Developer. This blog is a place where I share my study notes, development scripts, tutorials, and insights that I've picked up along the way. Whether you're here to learn something new, find solutions, or just explore, I hope my notes and content can be of value to you. If you get something useful out of them, I'll be more than happy!

This blog is proudly hosted on my homelab, which I built and maintain myself. I have a strong interest in self-hosting and enjoy experimenting with different technologies to improve and customize my infrastructure.

But this blog isn't all about coding. I also share stories from my travels, reviews, and the occasional slice of life. When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll find me out in nature hiking, skiing, or fishing. Music is my constant companion, and I have a growing love for entrepreneurship and building new ideas.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, thoughts, or just want to say hello. I'm very good at responding to messages and emails, so don't hesitate to contact me!
Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading. ðŸ––
